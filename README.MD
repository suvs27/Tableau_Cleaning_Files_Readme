# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

###  Suvarna Sampale

** In this project, I analyzed Citi Bike trips and popular stations in the Summer of 2018 and Summer of 2019.  I downloaded csv files for Citi Bike Trip Histories from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data for (1) June, July, and August 2018 and (2) June, July, and August 2019.  I combined all of these files in Tableau using the UNION (not Join) function and exported all the data to a single csv file.  This csv file had approximately 12,493,032 rows.  I then cleaned the csv file in Pandas and imported it back into Tableau to do my analysis.

##  Citi Bike in Summer: Trips and Popular Stations in the Summers of 2018 & 2019

** There were a total of 12,493,032 Citi Bike trips taken in 2018 and 2019.

** Citi Bike usage in the Summer of 2019 went up 14 % from the previous Summer of 2018.

** Based on the number of bike trips, August was the most popular month for Citi Bike in the Summer of 2018 and Summer of 2019.

** In the Summer of 2018 and 2019, the overwhelming majority of Citi Bike riders were Annual Subscribers.  This is surprising because one  may think that the number of 3 day and 24 hour pass users would be higher with summer tourism and favorable weather.

** "On the first three Saturdays in August between the hours of 7 am and 1pm, nearly seven miles of New York City's streets are open to the public to play, run, walk and bike." (from NYC website).  This festival is known as Summer Streets.  Citi Bikes are free to use on these days and discounts are given for annual Citi Bike subscriptions.  However, the data showed that these incentives did not cause a large increase in the number of bike rides on the days of the Summer Streets festival in August, and there were other days in August where the number of bike rides was much greater.

** An analysis of the  percent difference in the number of bike trips per day in the Summer of 2019 compared to the previous year in the Summer of 2018 showed that that on some days in the summer of 2019 there was over a 100 % increase in the number of bike trips taken.

** A comparison of the start stations in 2018 and 2019 may reveal one reason for the increase in the number of bike trips.  The number of start stations increased in 2019 by 2.67% (from 768 to 807) giving customers access to bikes at more locations. 

** The top start station location in the Summer of 2018 and Summer of 2019 was Pershing Square North.  This is right near Grand Central Station, a busy commuter hub.

** Some of the top 10 start station locations in the Summer of 2019 were in the vicinity of busy transportation hubs like the Port Authority, Penn Station, and Union Square.  The bottom 10 start stations included areas historically thought to be unsafe in NYC like Crown Heights or areas where the typical city resident would not have reason to visit (such as a bus depot).
